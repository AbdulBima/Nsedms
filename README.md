## About

The repository streamlines employee management with features like new employee registration, role-based access control, leave request management, and comprehensive employee statistics. The backend uses a Solidity smart contract for transparent, future-proof employee register and a Node.js server that interfaces with the contract via Ether.js.
The backend repository code can be found in my list of repositories.
